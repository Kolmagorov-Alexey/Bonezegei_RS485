# Bonezegei_RS485
### Arduino Library for RS485 to UART Converter using MAX485

Bonezegei RS485 is an Arduino library that enables the use of RS485 to UART converter modules based on the MAX485 chip. The library allows bidirectional communication between RS485 and UART devices, as well as read and write operations on both interfaces. The library supports half-duplex and full-duplex modes, as well as automatic direction control  and  collision detection. The  library  is compatible with  boards that use  the  Serial or Bonezegei_SoftSerial classes.
